# Team finder 

Like the name suggests, this is an app that someone can use to build a team for an upcoming project in the work environment. As well as having a way to look up employees and their details in a MySQL database, users may add people that fit their needs to a 'shortlist'. The 'shortlist' users make can be compiled together from other searches, and people can be removed at any time. Administrators of the organization also have the ability to create and update users through a password locked panel. For those who wish to use this for yourselves, feel free to clone the repo. Things such as configurations in databaseConfig.js may need to be edited to fit your setup. The schema for the database I used is as follows, however can be edited to your wants and needs:
